This project aims to enhance the security of Bancolombia's online services by implementing a robust phishing detection system. The system leverages data from the Phishing Domain Database, a comprehensive repository of phishing domains and threats.

It provides real-time information on the latest threats, categorizing them as active, inactive, or invalid. The database is updated hourly to ensure the most current threat data is available.
